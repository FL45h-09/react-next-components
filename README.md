# ⚛️ React + Next.js Components Repo

Welcome to the **React + Next.js Components** repo — a collection of clean, reusable JavaScript components built for modern web apps.

> This repo is not a package. It’s just a stash of code blocks — drop in what you need or contribute something useful. Real devs helping devs.

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

All components live in the top-level `components/` directory.  
Each component goes in **its own folder**, like this:

---
Please make sure to keep it modular, readable, and easy to plug-n-play.

---

## ✅ Contribution Rules

### 🔨 Adding a New Component

- Create a new folder inside `components/` using **PascalCase**.
  - Example: `components/FadeInSection/FadeInSection.js`
- Include an `index.js` to export the component.
- Stick to functional components written in **JavaScript (not TypeScript)**.
- Local styling only (CSS modules, inline styles, Tailwind — up to you).
- Keep the component **self-contained and reusable**.
- Use descriptive names and **avoid hardcoded logic**.

### 🔁 Updating an Existing Component

You can update a component **if you’re improving it**, not just tweaking style.

- Valid reasons: bug fix, optimization, adding optional props.
- Don’t change core behavior unless needed.
- Leave clear comments and meaningful commit messages.
- One component = one PR. Keep it focused.

---

## ❌ Don’ts

- ❌ No TypeScript files.
- ❌ No `src/` directory.
- ❌ No combining multiple components in one folder.
- ❌ No broken or demo code.
- ❌ No global CSS unless required.
- ❌ Don’t change others' code just for preference.
